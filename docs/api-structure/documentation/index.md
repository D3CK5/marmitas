# Marmitas API Structure Documentation

This documentation package provides comprehensive documentation of the Marmitas backend API structure, including detailed explanations, developer guidelines, and visual diagrams.

## Contents

1. [API Directory Structure](./api-directory-structure.md) - Detailed documentation of the current backend API directory structure
2. [Developer Guidelines](./developer-guidelines.md) - Guidelines for developers working with the API structure
3. [Structure Diagrams](./structure-diagrams.md) - Visual diagrams of the API structure

## Purpose

This documentation addresses implementation gap D-APISTRUCT-001 by providing clear and comprehensive documentation of the current backend API structure, enabling developers to understand how the current implementation relates to the originally planned structure, and providing guidelines for consistent API development.

## Documentation Overview

### API Directory Structure

The API Directory Structure document provides a detailed description of the current backend API organization, including:

- Complete directory structure overview
- Detailed description of each directory's purpose and contents
- Explanation of dependency relationships between components
- Illustration of the request flow through the API structure
- Discussion of directory structure conventions

This document serves as the primary reference for understanding the current API structure.

### Developer Guidelines

The Developer Guidelines provide concrete instructions and best practices for working with the current API structure, including:

- Guidelines for adding new API endpoints
- Code style and naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Error handling patterns
- Testing guidelines
- API extension and modification approaches

These guidelines ensure consistency and proper integration with the existing codebase.

### Structure Diagrams

The Structure Diagrams document provides visual representations of the API structure, including:

- Directory structure diagram
- Component relationship diagram
- Request flow diagram
- Module dependency diagram
- Authentication flow diagram
- API endpoint structure diagram
- Comparison to the original plan structure

These visual aids help developers quickly understand the organization and relationships within the API structure.

## Usage Guide

This documentation should be used in the following scenarios:

1. **New Developers**: Start with the Structure Diagrams for a visual overview, then read the API Directory Structure document for details, and refer to the Developer Guidelines when implementing features.

2. **Existing Developers**: Use the Developer Guidelines as a reference for consistent development practices, and consult the Structure Diagrams when explaining the system to others.

3. **Architects**: Review the API Directory Structure and compare with the original plan structure to evaluate alignment and potential improvements.

4. **For Decision Making**: Use this documentation along with the Impact Assessment documents to make informed decisions about potential restructuring.

## Relationship to Original Plan

This documentation package acknowledges the differences between the current implementation structure and the originally planned structure. While the current implementation uses a traditional Express.js structure with controllers and routes, the documentation provides clear mapping to the concepts in the original plan, enabling developers to understand the relationship between the two approaches.

The documentation serves as a bridge between the current implementation and the architectural vision expressed in the original plan, facilitating either continued development with the current structure or potential future migration to the planned structure.

## Maintenance

This documentation should be maintained alongside the codebase, with updates when:
- New directories or components are added
- Significant structural changes are made
- Development conventions are modified
- API patterns are enhanced

Regular reviews should verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the API structure.

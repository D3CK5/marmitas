# Structure Mapping: Current vs. Planned API Structure

This document maps concepts and components between the current implementation structure and the originally planned structure, providing a clear reference for developers familiar with either approach.

## Directory Structure Mapping

| Original Plan            | Current Implementation     | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `api/endpoints/`         | `controllers/` + `routes/` | API endpoint definitions and implementations |
| `api/dto/`               | `types/`                   | Data transfer objects and type definitions   |
| `api/validation/`        | Within `controllers/`      | Request validation logic                     |
| `api/documentation/`     | `docs/`                    | API documentation                            |
| `domain/`                | `models/` + `services/`    | Domain models and business logic             |
| `infrastructure/`        | `services/` (partially)    | External service integrations                |
| `utils/`                 | `utils/`                   | Utility functions                            |

## Concept Mapping

### API Endpoints

| Original Plan Concept        | Current Implementation                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Endpoint modules             | Controller classes + route files                       |
| Endpoint handlers            | Controller methods                                     |
| Route registration           | `routes/index.ts` registration functions               |
| Route parameters validation  | Parameter validation in controllers                    |
| Authorization rules          | `authRequired` flag in route registration + controller checks |

### Data Transfer Objects

| Original Plan Concept        | Current Implementation                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Request DTOs                 | Types used in controller parameters                    |
| Response DTOs                | Types used in controller responses                     |
| Validation schemas           | Inline validation in controllers                       |
| API contracts                | Defined in `docs/api-spec.ts`                          |

### Implementation Details

| Original Plan Concept        | Current Implementation                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Separation of concerns       | Partial - routes and controllers separate              |
| Domain/API separation        | Partial - through service layer                        |
| Self-documenting structure   | Traditional Express.js structure                       |
| API-first approach           | Documentation-supplemented approach                    |

## Functional Equivalence

Despite the structural differences, the current implementation provides functionally equivalent capabilities:

1. **API Routing**: Both structures support defining and handling API routes
2. **Request Validation**: Both approaches allow for validating incoming requests
3. **Authentication/Authorization**: Both support securing endpoints with authentication
4. **Response Formatting**: Both enable consistent response formatting
5. **Documentation**: Both include API documentation, though in different formats

## Structural Divergence Impact

The divergence in structure has the following impacts:

1. **Learning Curve**: Developers familiar with Express.js patterns can more easily understand the current structure
2. **Code Organization**: The planned structure would have provided more explicit separation of concerns
3. **Discoverability**: API-related code is spread across multiple directories in the current structure
4. **Extensibility**: Both approaches are extensible, though with different patterns
5. **Maintenance**: The current structure follows common Node.js/Express.js conventions

## Transition Considerations

If transition to the planned structure is considered:

1. **Refactoring Effort**: Moderate - requires reorganizing files but minimal logic changes
2. **Risk**: Low - primarily organizational changes rather than functional changes
3. **Testing Impact**: Minimal - functionality should remain unchanged
4. **Documentation Impact**: Moderate - would require updating development documentation

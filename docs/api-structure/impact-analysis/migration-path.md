# Migration Path Planning

This document outlines a detailed migration path for reorganizing the Marmitas backend API structure from the current `controllers/` and `routes/` pattern to the originally planned `api/endpoints` and `api/dto` structure.

## Migration Principles

1. **Minimize Disruption**: Plan for minimal disruption to ongoing development
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
3. **Incremental Approach**: Implement changes in manageable increments
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate functionality at each step
5. **Clear Communication**: Keep team members informed of structural changes

## Pre-Migration Preparation

### 1. Establish Version Control Baseline

- Create a feature branch specifically for restructuring
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage before beginning
- Document the current structure and functionality for reference

### 2. Development Environment Setup

- Prepare development environment for restructuring
- Create scripts to automate repetitive migration tasks
- Configure IDE tools to assist with refactoring

### 3. Team Preparation

- Communicate timeline and purpose to all team members
- Schedule migration during lower-activity periods
- Ensure all team members understand the new structure

## Phased Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation (Day 1)

1. Create the new directory structure:
   ```
   marmitas-backend/src/
   ├── api/
   │   ├── endpoints/    # For reorganized controllers and routes
   │   ├── dto/          # For type definitions
   │   ├── validation/   # For validation logic
   │   └── documentation/# For API documentation
   ```

2. Update project configuration if necessary
3. Create README files in each directory explaining the purpose

### Phase 2: API Documentation Migration (Day 1-2)

1. Move API documentation from `docs/` to `api/documentation/`
2. Update references to API documentation
3. Test documentation access and functionality

### Phase 3: Type Definitions Migration (Day 2-3)

1. Identify and categorize type definitions to be moved
2. Create appropriate subdirectories in `api/dto/`
3. Move type definitions to `api/dto/` directory
4. Update import paths in files that use the types
5. Test compile to ensure all imports are correctly updated

### Phase 4: Endpoints Migration - By Module (Day 3-7)

For each API module (e.g., auth, users, products):

1. Create corresponding module directory in `api/endpoints/`
2. Move controller logic and route definitions for the module
3. Update import paths in moved files
4. Update references to the module in other files
5. Run tests to verify functionality of the migrated module
6. Update relevant documentation

Example organization for authentication module:
```
api/endpoints/auth/
├── auth.routes.ts    # Route definitions
├── auth.controller.ts # Controller implementation
├── auth.validation.ts # Validation rules
└── index.ts         # Exports for the module
```

### Phase 5: Route Registration Refactoring (Day 7-8)

1. Update main router configuration to use new endpoint structure
2. Refactor route registration to match new organization
3. Test all API routes to ensure correct registration
4. Update server startup code if necessary

### Phase 6: Validation & Cleanup (Day 8)

1. Run complete test suite to verify all functionality
2. Remove deprecated files and directories (after confirming no references)
3. Update any remaining documentation referring to old structure
4. Clean up any temporary migration files or scripts

## Post-Migration Tasks

### 1. Documentation Updates

- Update developer onboarding documentation
- Create migration summary document
- Document the new architecture and organization

### 2. Verification

- Perform end-to-end testing of all API functionality
- Verify documentation accuracy
- Review for any missed references to old structure

### 3. Developer Support

- Provide guidance to developers on the new structure
- Schedule brief knowledge-sharing session on new organization
- Create quick reference guide for the team

## Rollback Plan

In case of significant issues with the migration:

1. **Quick Rollback**: Revert to previous structure using version control
2. **Partial Rollback**: Identify which components are causing issues and selectively roll back
3. **Phased Retry**: Address identified issues and retry migration with improved approach

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All API functionality works correctly in the new structure
2. All tests pass successfully
3. Documentation reflects the new structure
4. Developers can navigate and work with the new structure effectively
5. No references to the old structure remain in the codebase

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Preparation | Baseline, setup, communication | 1 day | None |
| Phase 1 | Create directory structure | 0.5 day | Preparation |
| Phase 2 | Migrate documentation | 0.5-1 day | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | Migrate type definitions | 1-1.5 days | Phase 1 |
| Phase 4 | Migrate endpoints (all modules) | 3-4 days | Phase 1, 3 |
| Phase 5 | Refactor route registration | 1 day | Phase 4 |
| Phase 6 | Validation and cleanup | 0.5-1 day | Phase 1-5 |
| Post-Migration | Doc updates, verification | 1-2 days | Phase 1-6 |

**Total Migration Time: 8-12 days**

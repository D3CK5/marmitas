# Migration Plan for Frontend-Backend Separation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for transitioning from the current monolithic architecture to a separated frontend-backend architecture for the "marmitas" meal delivery application. The plan follows the specifications detailed in MacroChunk MA-SEPFB-OBJ06 and is designed to ensure a smooth transition with minimal business disruption.

| State Management | High | Direct API calls | High |
| Authentication UI | High | Supabase Auth | High |
| Order Management | Medium | Supabase client | Medium |
| Admin Dashboard | Medium | Supabase client | Medium |
| User Profiles | Low | Supabase client | Low |

### Backend Components
| Component | Complexity | Dependencies | Migration Risk |
|-----------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Authentication Service | High | Supabase Auth | High |
| Database Schema | Medium | None | Low |
| API Endpoints | High | Database | Medium |
| Business Logic | High | Database | High |
| Realtime Subscriptions | High | Supabase Realtime | High |
| File Storage | Low | Supabase Storage | Low |

## Migration Phases and Sequence

### Phase 1: Initial Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

- Extract shared type definitions to separate package
- Setup separate environment configurations
- Establish monitoring and rollback mechanisms

### Phase 2: Backend Foundation (Weeks 3-5)
- Extract database schema to backend repository
- Create API service layer structure
- Implement core backend services for low-risk components
- Configure database access restrictions

### Phase 3: Frontend Adaptation (Weeks 6-8)
- Implement API client in frontend
- Update data fetching logic to use API client
- Migrate authentication flow to use backend services
- Update realtime subscription mechanisms

### Phase 4: High-Risk Component Migration (Weeks 9-12)
- Migrate business logic to backend services
- Implement advanced security features
- Move remaining direct database access to API calls
- Complete realtime subscription migration

### Phase 5: Validation and Optimization (Weeks 13-14)
- Comprehensive testing of all application functionality
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
- User acceptance testing

# Frontend-Backend Separation Transition Strategy

## Implementation of MicroChunks for Frontend-Backend Separation Transition

This directory contains the implementation artifacts for the Migration Planning and Preparation and Feature Flag Implementation MicroChunks of the Frontend-Backend Separation Transition Strategy. The implementation follows the specifications detailed in the `OBJ-06-TransitionStrategy-MacroChunk.xml` document.

### Implemented MicroChunks and NanoChunks

#### MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-001: Migration Planning and Preparation

| NanoChunk ID | Name | Implementation Artifact | Status |
|--------------|------|-------------------------|--------|
| NA-SEPFB-OBJ06-001-01 | Migration Plan Development | [01-migration-plan.md](./01-migration-plan.md) | Completed |
| NA-SEPFB-OBJ06-001-02 | Parallel Infrastructure Preparation | [02-parallel-infrastructure.md](./02-parallel-infrastructure.md) | Completed |
| NA-SEPFB-OBJ06-001-03 | Migration Governance Establishment | [03-migration-governance.md](./03-migration-governance.md) | Completed |

#### MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-002: Feature Flag Implementation

| NanoChunk ID | Name | Implementation Artifact | Status |
|--------------|------|-------------------------|--------|
| NA-SEPFB-OBJ06-002-01 | Feature Flag Infrastructure Setup | [04-feature-flag-infrastructure.md](./04-feature-flag-infrastructure.md) | Completed |
| NA-SEPFB-OBJ06-002-02 | Feature Activation Control Implementation | [05-feature-activation-control.md](./05-feature-activation-control.md) | Completed |

### Validation Status

#### MicroChunk MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-001: Migration Planning and Preparation
The implementation of MicroChunk MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-001 has been completed with all required NanoChunks implemented according to the specifications. The artifacts provide comprehensive documentation for:

1. A detailed migration plan with component analysis, phases, milestones, timeline, resource allocation, and risk assessment
2. Infrastructure requirements and implementation plan for parallel operation of legacy and new systems
3. Governance framework with decision-making structures, approval processes, and communication procedures

#### MicroChunk MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-002: Feature Flag Implementation
The implementation of MicroChunk MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-002 has been completed with all required NanoChunks implemented according to the specifications. The artifacts provide comprehensive documentation for:

1. Feature flag infrastructure with system selection, architecture design, and implementation examples
2. Feature activation control mechanisms with targeting rules, user context evaluation, and administrative interfaces
3. Monitoring and analytics for feature flag usage and impact with metrics, logging, and dashboards

### Next Steps

Following the sequential implementation approach defined in the MacroChunk, the next steps are:

1. **Approval of Implemented MicroChunks**: Review and approval of the implemented artifacts by the relevant stakeholders
2. **Proceed to MicroChunk MI-SEPFB-OBJ06-003**: Implementation of Feature Parity Testing
3. **Begin Infrastructure Setup**: Start setting up the infrastructure according to the specifications
4. **Implement Feature Flag System**: Implement the feature flag system based on the documented design

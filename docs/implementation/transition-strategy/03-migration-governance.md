## Approval Gates and Processes

### Approval Gate Process
1. **Preparation**: Documentation of deliverables and evidence
2. **Review**: Evaluation by designated reviewers
3. **Decision**: Approval, Conditional Approval, or Rejection
4. **Follow-up**: Address conditions or rejections if applicable

### Gate Approval Matrix

| Gate | Deliverables | Required Approvers | Optional Reviewers |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Migration Plan Approval | Migration plan document, Risk assessment | Technical Director, Product Owner | Executive Sponsor |
| Phase 1 Completion | Repository structure, Shared types, Environment configs | Technical Lead, Lead Developers | Steering Committee |
| Phase 2 Completion | Backend API foundation, Database migration | Technical Lead, Backend Lead | Technical Committee |
| Phase 3 Completion | Frontend integration, Feature parity evidence | Technical Lead, Frontend Lead | Technical Committee |
| Phase 4 Completion | Complete separation verification, Performance metrics | Technical Lead, QA Lead | Steering Committee |
| Final Approval | Legacy decommissioning plan, Training materials | Steering Committee | Executive Sponsor |

### Documentation Requirements for Approval
- Completion evidence for all planned deliverables
- Test results demonstrating quality and feature parity
- Risk assessment and mitigation status
- Metrics comparing performance before and after changes
- Outstanding issues and resolution plan

## Escalation Process

### Escalation Triggers
- Blocking technical issues unresolved for >2 days
- Scope changes impacting timeline by >5 days
- Quality metrics below defined thresholds
- Resource conflicts affecting critical path
- Security or compliance concerns

### Escalation Levels
1. **Level 1**: Technical Lead (resolve within 1 day)
2. **Level 2**: Technical Committee (resolve within 2 days)
3. **Level 3**: Steering Committee (resolve within 1 week)
4. **Level 4**: Executive Sponsor (resolve by next steering meeting)

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder Group | Communication Needs | Channel | Frequency | Responsible |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Executive Leadership | Strategic progress, Business impact | Executive brief | Monthly | Technical Director |
| Product Team | Feature status, User impact | Status report | Bi-weekly | Product Owner |

## Issue Management Process

### Issue Tracking
- Dedicated JIRA project for migration issues
- Issues categorized by type, severity, and component
- SLAs for initial response and resolution times
- Clear ownership assignments for each issue

### Issue Prioritization Matrix

| Severity | Business Impact | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Prevents migration progress or affects production | 1 hour | 1 day |
| High | Blocks specific component or significant delay | 4 hours | 2 days |
| Medium | Impacts timeline but has workaround | 1 day | 1 week |
| Low | Minor issue, no significant impact | 2 days | 2 weeks |

### Issue Resolution Process
1. **Identification**: Issue reported and logged
2. **Triage**: Severity and priority assigned
3. **Assignment**: Owner determined based on expertise
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis performed
5. **Resolution**: Issue fixed or mitigated
6. **Verification**: Solution tested and verified
7. **Closure**: Issue documented and closed

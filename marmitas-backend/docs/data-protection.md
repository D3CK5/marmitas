# Data Protection Implementation

This document describes the implementation of data protection measures in the Marmitas application, following the Security and Compliance MacroChunk (MI-SEPFB-OBJ04-003).

## Overview

The data protection implementation consists of two main components:

1. **Data Encryption at Rest** - Encrypting sensitive data stored in the database and local storage
2. **Data Access Control** - Implementing fine-grained authorization for controlling access to data

## 1. Data Encryption at Rest

### Backend Encryption

We've implemented a secure encryption system for protecting sensitive data stored in the database:

- **Encryption Service**: Uses AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode) for strong encryption with authentication
- **Database Encryption Service**: Manages encryption/decryption of sensitive fields in database records
- **Key Management**: Implements secure key generation, storage, and rotation

#### Key Features:

- Strong encryption of sensitive personal and payment data
- Secure key rotation and versioning for maintaining encryption security
- Encrypted fields are transparently decrypted when accessed by authorized services

### Frontend Encryption

For the frontend, we've implemented a secure local storage system:

- **Secure Storage Utility**: Uses Web Crypto API for client-side encryption
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 key derivation with high iteration count for strong key security
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Same encryption algorithm as the backend for consistent security

## 2. Data Access Control

### Authorization Service

We've implemented a role-based access control system:

- **Role Hierarchy**: Anonymous → User → Customer → Admin → System
- **Permission Model**: Resource-based permissions with action types (create, read, update, delete, list, manage)
- **Ownership Conditions**: Support for data ownership conditions to restrict access to user's own data

### Authorization Middleware

Two middleware components enforce access control:

- **Request Authorization**: Validates user permissions before allowing access to endpoints
- **Data Filtering**: Filters response data based on user permissions to prevent unauthorized data access

## Implementation Details

### Encrypted Fields

The following fields are encrypted in the database:

| Table | Encrypted Fields |
|-------|-----------------|
| profiles | phone, document_number, personal_notes |
| user_addresses | phone, address_details |
| user_verifications | verification_data |
| payment_methods | card_number, card_holder_name, card_cvv |
| orders | customer_notes, payment_details |
| messages | content |
| support_tickets | description |

### Key Rotation

- **Automatic Rotation**: Keys are automatically rotated every 90 days (configurable)
- **Key Versioning**: Support for multiple key versions to allow decryption of data encrypted with previous keys
- **Backup System**: Secure backup of previous encryption keys for data recovery

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**: Production environments should use a secure key management system like Azure Key Vault or AWS KMS
2. **Transport Security**: All data is protected in transit using TLS 1.3
3. **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory as soon as possible
4. **Monitoring**: Encryption operations are logged for security auditing

## Configuration

Configuration options for data protection are available in the application environment variables:

```
# Encryption Settings
ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true
ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH=../infrastructure/keys/encryption.key
ENCRYPTION_KEY_BACKUP_DIR=../infrastructure/keys/backup

# Key Rotation Settings
KEY_ROTATION_ENABLED=true
KEY_ROTATION_DAYS=90
AUTOMATIC_KEY_ROTATION=true
```

## Validation

The data protection implementation has been validated against the following criteria:

1. Sensitive data is properly encrypted in the database
2. Encrypted data can be successfully decrypted by authorized services
3. Key rotation works correctly and maintains data accessibility
4. Access control correctly restricts data access based on user roles and ownership
5. Frontend secure storage correctly encrypts sensitive local data

## Next Steps

1. **Hardware Security Module Integration**: For production, integrate with an HSM for enhanced key security
2. **Encryption at Use**: Implement protection for data in use (memory encryption)
3. **Field-Level Encryption Policies**: Allow more granular encryption policies based on data classification
